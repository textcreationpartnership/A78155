         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That the ≈øaid Lieutenant of the Tower, for his own, and Relations Advantage and Accomodation, hath expended (under the notion of nece≈ø≈øary repairs) much of the publick money in fitting and making up Lodgings for Pri≈øoners, from whom there hath been extorted mo≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea≈øonable rates for the ≈øaid Lodgings: As for in≈øtance: The ≈øaid Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant hath him≈øelf received to his own private u≈øe from Mr. <hi>A≈øhburnham</hi> 40 <hi>s.</hi> a week;<note place="margin">I have heard that Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Overton,</hi> lodging at one Mr. <hi>Cuttingmans</hi> the Lieutenant of the Towers brother, and refu≈øing any longer to pay as he had done <hi>30 s.</hi> a week for his lodging; the ≈øaid Lieutenant of the Tower threatned in the hearing of a Gentleman of worth, to put the Major General in the Dungeon.</note> from Sir <hi>Henry Littleton,</hi> 40 <hi>s.</hi> a week, and from Sir <hi>Tho. P yton,</hi> forty ≈øhillings a week, or thereabouts; which they in prudence complyed withall, to the end they might enjoy that Freedom and Liberty which others could not have, and they paid dear for; be≈øides great weekly ≈øums which his Kindred received for tho≈øe Lodgings which ought to be free for Pri≈øoners: In≈øomuch that the Tower, formerly a noble and unexpen≈øive Pri≈øon, is by him the ≈øaid <hi>Bark≈øtead</hi>'s ba≈øe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øes and connivances rendred a rooking Pinfold; many being rai≈øed in that place by the ruines of poor Pri≈øoners.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Ca≈øe of Mr. <hi>John Partman</hi> brought before the late A≈ø≈øembly, who voted his Impri≈øonment illegal and unju≈øt, de≈øerves Con≈øideration, and is of it ≈øelf ≈øingly ≈øufficient to turn ≈øuch a Traytor as this ba≈øe Truck<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="8">8. That the ≈øaid Lieutenant of the Tower hath demeaned him≈øelf ≈øo in≈øolently towards Pri≈øoners, &amp; their Friends who came to vi≈øit them,<note place="margin">E≈øpecially to that worthy Per≈øon Major General <hi>Overton,</hi> his Wife, Children and Friends, as I have heard, and I believe is publickly known.</note> and rendred him≈øelf ≈øo ridiculous in both publick and more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gro≈øs practi≈øes, (which I ≈øhall here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline in≈øetting) that he hath cau≈øed much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to fall upon Religion, and by that means is become ≈øo ≈øcandalous all the Nation over, that he ≈øtinks in the No≈øtrils of both Good and Bad.</p>

And la≈øtly, That it may appear how meer a Time-≈øerving Truck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler he the ≈øaid <hi>Bark≈øtead</hi> is, as plainly and undeniably he was; and how he now clo≈øes in with a Commonwealth from no other principles than the pre≈øervation of his intere≈øt, and to ≈øhelter him≈øelf under the Armies ≈øhield from the La≈øhes of Law, which otherwi≈øe might light heavily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; It may be made manife≈øt that he was improving all the intere≈øt he had to ≈øecure the Tower for the late Protector, <hi>alias</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> in oppo≈øition to the Army, till he was frighted forth of that a≈ø≈øay by a Colonel who told him he was undone if he complyed not with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as that Colonel hath confe≈ø≈øed in the audience of forty Per≈øons.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:168603:4"/>
            <p>Now if this Charge bear ≈øuch a proportion with truth, as that the ≈øaid Lieutenant of the Tower is guilty of the Sub≈øtance of what is in this Paper alleaged again≈øt him: Then</p>
            <p n="1">1. DOth it ≈øtand with the honour and reputation of the Parliament and Army, and the ≈øafety and ≈øecurity of the Tower, to continue him in that command? Or (according to what the Parliament hath lately voted, and the Army have publickly declared to pull the wicked out of their places) to receive him into any other Office or Place of Tru≈øt and Power within the Commonwealth? Or can it be rationally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood that the Army (under an owning of their late Apo≈øtacy and real repentance for the ≈øame) do or can propo≈øe Indemnity for all, with out any Di≈øtinction either in relation to per≈øons or things?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he, and ≈øuch as he be continued, and tho≈øe who for Con≈øcience ≈øake either ≈øaperated from the late Apo≈øtacy, or were laid a≈øide by the grand Apo≈øtate, are left out; what then doth the late great Noy≈øe and Change naturally and intentionally ≈øignifie, farther than a tran≈ølation of the Apo≈øtatical Cau≈øe and De≈øign (under the Cloak of the Good Old Cau≈øe) out of <hi>Oliver Cromwels</hi> Family into ≈øome other? Or out of a ≈øingle Per≈øon into ≈øeveral Per≈øons, where Tyranny ≈øtill remains the ≈øame, as ≈øtinking water that may be poured out of one into ≈øeveral ve≈ø≈øels, but remains the ≈øame water, though the ve≈ø≈øels were never ≈øo ≈øweet?</p>
            <p n="3">3 Should the Army return no nearer the Good Old Cau≈øe in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for their declen≈øion from it, than to ≈øuch an Oligarchy wherein they may ≈øhrowd and ≈øhelter a private intere≈øt in oppo≈øition to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; will they not plainly unveyl the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt Hypocri≈øie in the world, in profe≈ø≈øing them≈øelves ≈øen≈øible of an Apo≈øtacy, and expre≈ø≈øing repentance for it, when at that time they re≈øolved to remain in it? Will they not thereby plainly prove them≈øelves Apo≈øtates indeed, not ≈øuch as were led a≈øide by weakne≈ø≈øes, but ≈øuch as wilfully and wickedly turned out of the way? Oh how will they then ≈øtink as corrupt Carrion in the No≈øtrils of all Nations?</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the Parliament and Council of State walk by the Armies Rule in this re≈øpect, and they go hand in hand together, and perpetuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves (as I hope neither Parliament nor Army intend) will they not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in practi≈øe ju≈øtifie that wickedne≈øs in the Apo≈øtacy, which mo≈øt of them condemned in words? And will they not al≈øo according to the Tenour of this Text, <hi>Thou art made whole: go thy way, ≈øin no more, le≈øt a wor≈øe thing befall thee</hi> be judicially engaged into that which will rather perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate their infamy, than their power; ≈øo that the old reproaches ca≈øt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, will revive with a new remembrance, and they will really ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie tho≈øe who ≈øeem to condemn them≈øelves for interrupting them, and as really condemn <hi>them≈øelves</hi> in that wherein they now ≈øeem ju≈øtified? Will they not by this means in≈øtead of healing our Breaches, and re≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of pathes to dwell in, create further and greater di≈ø-unions, and ≈øo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168603:5"/> give the common Enemy that opportunity, which will undoubtedly and undeniably e≈øtabli≈øh his Throne in the mid≈øt of us?</p>
            <p n="5">5. But if the Parliament and Council of State have more real thoughts for Reformation, (as I hope they have) how comes it then to pa≈ø≈øe that they receive tho≈øe into places and preferment under them, who were actually engaged in the Apo≈øtacy, and reJect, at lea≈øt neglect tho≈øe who have ≈øuffered for Con≈øcience ≈øake, they being equally able with tho≈øe they entertain, and far hone≈øter? Doth not this argue great ingratitude to tho≈øe who have denyed them≈øelves, to vindicate their power? And is it not very unbecoming the profe≈ø≈øions they make, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to countenance tho≈øe who court them for places, than ≈øuch as in con≈øcience cannot ≈øeek them≈øelves? If Favour or Friend≈øhip mu≈øt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it from de≈øert, then doth that ≈øpirit ≈øway the Scepter which Rules in Righteou≈øne≈øs?</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall not in this place, nor at this pre≈øent, make mention of the Death of Mr. <hi>Syndercom,</hi> and what he ≈øuffered in the Tower by him; the Story is too well known, and will not ≈øuddenly be forgotten. I ≈øhall only urge that, to add to his former cruelties, the ≈øaid Lieutenant of the Tower did deal mo≈øt barbarou≈øly and unmercifully with that famous, and Reverend Divine Doctor <hi>John Hewyt,</hi> who being committed to the Tower upon the ≈øugge≈øtions, and the Jealou≈øies of the late decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed Tyrant, he u≈øed all the wayes that po≈ø≈øibly he could contrive to adde unto his Grievances, and would not grant admittance to many Godly and Reverend Divines who took the paines to come and vi≈øit him in the Day of his Di≈øtre≈ø≈øe; nay he would not ≈øuffer the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lady his mo≈øt dear Wife to have acce≈øs unto him, but only when he plea≈øed: which among≈øt many other almo≈øt inexpre≈ø≈øible ≈øufferings; was the occa≈øion of a great and dangerous ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, which did afflict him to the jeopardy of his life: whereupon petitioning to the Protector then living, ≈øhe could not procure him the liberty of a cleer air, without putting in great ≈øecurity, and a guard upon his per≈øon, who meant nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fight nor fly away. It were too long in this place to in≈øert the Injuries with which he was tormented a little before his Execution, when he was preparing him≈øelf for a better world, which were ≈øo into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, that a <hi>Turk</hi> would not offer the like ≈øo the mo≈øt de≈øpicable of Chri≈øtians. For your further ≈øatisfaction in this and the particulars thereof, I ≈øhall referre you to the Petition of his Honourable Con≈øort which ≈øhe pre≈øented to the late di≈ø≈øolved Parliament, at the fir≈øt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Se≈ø≈øions</p>
